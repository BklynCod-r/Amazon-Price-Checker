# Amazon Price Checker

This is a python script that will check the price of an item you want.

In the script you will have to input the link of the item, and your email info.

This script runs off your own computer so I or anyone else won't be able to see your credentials.

It only works for gmail as of now. In the script you can change the condition of the price.

Meaning that when the price of the item is at a price you want it will notifiy you.

I made this following a tutorial from a YouTuber called Dev Ed!
